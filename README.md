 # 🧼 Uniqlo Hoodie Price vs Review Analysis

This project uses web scraping and data analysis to explore the relationship between product price and customer review ratings for men's hoodies on Uniqlo's U.S. website.

## 🔍 Overview

- Scraped hoodie product data using **Selenium**
- Extracted product **titles, prices, and review ratings**
- Cleaned and structured data using **Pandas**
- Visualized the correlation between price and rating using **Matplotlib**
- Calculated and interpreted the **R² value** to assess correlation strength

## 📊 Key Findings

- Weak correlation found between price and average star rating (low R²)
- Plotted a regression line to visualize the relationship

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Selenium  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scipy (for linear regression)

## 📁 Files

- `uniqlo_scraper.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with scraping and analysis code
- `uniqlo_products.csv` – Cleaned product data
